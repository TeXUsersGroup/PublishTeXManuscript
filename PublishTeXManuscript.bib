                  do the publisher's job, but eventually had to
                  because the publisher didn't have a clue about
                  typesetting, although to be honest, the author did
                  some stupid things as well, but fortunately,
                  everything is all right now, however this is an
                  experience the author wouldn't wish upon anyone, but
                  is still going to narrate it for your greatest
                  enjoyment, and will do so both crying and laughing
                  (yes, that was the title)},
